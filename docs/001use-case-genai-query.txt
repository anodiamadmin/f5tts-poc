The following is for your attention. I shall ask subsequent queries on this context.
Use Case: We are using F5-TTS model to do the following Voice Cloning:
Create a web/ mobile app (React FastAPI, MySQL and AI Model) where users can upload training voices. For each training voice, AI Model should learn the features like:
•	Acoustic/ Physiological Features: Timbre (Voice Quality), Pitch (Fundamental Frequency F0), Loudness (Intensity)
•	Linguistic/ Behavioural Features: Accent and Dialect, Tone (Prosody/Intonation), Speech Rate and Rhythm (Tempo and Cadence)
Any User should be also upload texts of any length. Finally, a user can ask the app to generate speech output for the text in any of the training voices that the AI model has been trained in. The Model will infer text to speech and the speech should be in the exact Acoustic/Physiological and Linguistic/ Behavioural features of the particular training voice. So this use case has 2 components: text to speech and voice cloning. 
High Priority considerations:
•	Open-source/ Free Licence models
•	Exact Voice Cloning
•	Zero shot or minimal training
•	Industry standard for AI covers and "deepfake" voice acting/ cloning
•	English Language and common accents only
Not considered now, may be in later use cases:
•	Real-Time Voice Cloning
•	Musical vocals
•	Multilingual voice output
